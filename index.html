            <p>I am a student of software engineering in the Thinkful Flex bootcamp currently living in Nashville, TN.</p>
            <p> What interest me most are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Spending time with family </li>
              <li> Basketball </li>
              <li> Tech </li>
              <li> Travel </li>

              <h2>About Shaquille</h2>
            </header>
            <p>I graduated from Tennessee State University with a B.B.A. And continued to attain my M.B.A from Lipscomb University. I have always had a knack for business which led me to become a serial entreprenuer and a sports agent that negotiates contracts for professional athletes.</p>

            <p> I also work a full career job in FinTech, which helped me to discover my passion for tech. However, I had earlier signs of this passion when I always had the desire to create my own websites, logos, or generate app concepts.</p>

            <p>I decided it was time to make a change from FinTech and follow my interests, so I enrolled into the Thinkful software engineering program. It would be very fulfilling to combine two passions of mine: Sport and Tech.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer, or add an additional collaborator, please reach out! I am beyond excited to get my Tech journey started!</p>
